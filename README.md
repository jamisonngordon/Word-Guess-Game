# Word-Guess-Game
A word guess game that is very similar in style to the classic game hang man. This version has a video game theme, however, so any words that are served will be related to video games.

# Usage
Press any key on the keyboard to guess letters of the random word one by one. You have five guesses to get the word right otherwise you will loose and the game will reset.
